# Mood Selector

I have tried my best to make this application. I was not much familiar with `useContext()` hook from react. I took help from some of the documentations from Gemini API and nextJS.

Although I could not add Spotify API because the endpoint was broken and was not working. 

If I was given a little mode time for this project. I would have added some animations using Framer. I don't know abou this much yet. 

Thank You.
